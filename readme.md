Current Status: 50% complete.

## Description
When it is finished, this game is designed to be a multiplayer realtime version of the Laser Squad mission "Moonbase Assault".  One side must defend a moonbase from attack, and the other side must destroy all the computers before the time runs out.


## Game Design
* There are two sides.
* The defenders must defend the computers by killing the attackers.
* The attackers must destroy the computers.
* The game is played for a fixed duration.  If enough computers are destroyed before this time, the attackers win, otherwise the defenders win.
* Human players always play as the attackers.
