## Game Design
* There are two sides.
* The defenders must defend the computers by killing the attackers.
* The attackers must destroy the computers.
* The game is played for a fixed duration.  If enough computers are destroyed before this time, the attackers win, otherwise the defenders win.
* Human players always play as the defenders.
