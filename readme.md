# Moonbase Assault

By Stephen Carlyle-Smith (stephen.carlylesmith@googlemail.com)

This game is designed to be a multiplayer realtime version of the Laser Squad (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Squad) mission "Moonbase Assault".  One side must defend a moonbase from attack, and the other side must destroy all the computers before the time runs out.

Current Status: It generally works, though lacks polish.


## Game Design
* There are two sides.
* The defenders must defend the computers by killing the attackers.
* The attackers must destroy the computers.
* The game is played for a fixed duration.  If enough computers are destroyed before this time, the attackers win, otherwise the defenders win.
* Human players always play as the defenders.


## Compiling
If you are trying to compile this, you'll probably want to use the development branch of SteveTech1, since that's what I usually develop against.
